## Notes on assignment
### Branching
For this assignment, I did not catch the fact that we were required to implement additonal/extra features on a separate branch.
I agree that this is obviously the smartest thing to do, but seeing as I was quite comfortable with adding additional features without affecting
the quality or reliability of the already implemented assignment-part of the system, I did not implement the extra features on a separate branch.
I have instead tried my absolute best to ensure that the extra content that I have implemented is mostly completely separated from the content relating to the
standard assignment. For the extra content that actually exists within the classes of the original assignment implementation in order for the extra features
to operate, I have tried to mark everything with a "*extra" comment so that it should be fairly easy to read/grade only the parts concerning the main assignment 
requirements.
### TDD
The application is built with the Maven framework and the testing pipeline used in the project is supplied using Github Actions with Maven.
The pipeline can be viewed by looking at the "Actions" tab in this repository
